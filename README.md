# A string conversation library in C
![logo.svg](logo.svg)  
This library can precisely convert numeric strings into integers of variable size.  
Right now, the library only supports signed and unsigned integers of 8,16 and 32bits only. 

## TODO
Check for boundaries before the conversion.
Signed and unsigned integers of 64 and 128 bits.
Floats of 32 and 64 bits.
